\title{Sequentially Compare Multiple Lists of Tables}
\usage{
compare_multiple_tables(list_of_tables)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_tables}{A list of named lists of data frames. Each named list should have identical names
across all entries to ensure accurate comparisons.}
}
\value{
A named list where each entry corresponds to the comparison results of a pair of lists.
Each comparison result is a named list of data frames, as generated by \code{compare_named_tables}.
}
\description{
This function sequentially compares multiple named lists of data frames. It is designed
to compare lists in a stepwise manner (e.g., A to B, B to C, etc.), storing the results
of each comparison.

\examples{
# Example usage:
list_of_tables <- list(A = tables_A, B = tables_B, C = tables_C)
all_comparisons <- compare_multiple_tables(list_of_tables)
